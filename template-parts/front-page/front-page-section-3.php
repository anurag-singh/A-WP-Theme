                    The event will provide opportunities for attendees to connect with others in the industry while testing their luck at casino tables and bid on silent auction packages and one of a kind opportunities, all while raising money for a vital nonprofit.

                    If you are unable to attend, please consider making a donation to Green Up Our Schools our non-profit beneficiary.
                    In 10 years, Greened Up students have diverted 8,100 tons of waste from landfills through their school wide projects.
                    93,300 youth 6-13 year olds have been set on course to be the future green leaders of tomorrow.
                    Through our partnership with Fulcrum Resources Environmental and Pacific Enterprise Bank this event will help support growing our green print in this community.
                    Our goals are: a healthy planet, a sustainable community, an empowered generation of students.
